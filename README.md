# Devoxx Windows Mobile App, "My Devoxx"

This is the official Windows Phone App for Devoxx Conferences. It is compatible to Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10 Mobile.

## No UWP?
Since it took so long to release Windows 10 Mobile, I decided to go from WP 8.1 but there will be a UWP Version of this App in the near future.

## Setup
Just get the code, open it in [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (Community Edtion is enough) and start coding.
